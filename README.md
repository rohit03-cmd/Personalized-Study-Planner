# Personalized-Study-Planner
A web application that creates tailored study plans based on user goals (e.g., "Prepare for CAT 2025") and feedback (e.g., "Iâ€™m struggling with calculus"). It uses NLP to interpret user input, A* to optimize the study schedule, Hill Climbing to adjust task priorities, and Min-Max to balance study and leisure activities.
